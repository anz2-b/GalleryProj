        <h1>Toji Fushiguro</h1>
        <p id="toji_desc">Toji Fushiguro (伏ふし黒ぐろ甚とう爾じ Fushiguro Tōji), formerly known as Toji Zenin (禪ぜん院いん甚とう爾じ Zen'in Tōji), and also known as the Sorcerer Killer (術じゅつ師し殺ごろし Jutsushi Goroshi), is a major antagonist in the Jujutsu Kaisen franchise.<br>

He is an infamous non-Curse User assassin and a former member of the Zenin Family, one of the three great family clans of the Jujutsu society, being the younger brother of Jinichi Zenin and nephew of Naobito Zenin, as well as the father of Megumi Fushiguro and step-father of Tsumiki Fushiguro.<br>

Toji was born with a Heavenly Restriction, which granted him immense physical abilities in exchange for being the one human on Earth to completely lack Cursed Energy. Combined with his genius intellect, Toji became a feared and dangerous assassin.</p>
